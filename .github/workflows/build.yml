# When a release is created or this workflow is manually triggered, it will:
# (1) confirm the CodeQL analysis was successful, (2) build the project using
# node lts/* on ubuntu-24.04, (3) upload an artifact for deployment to GitHub
# Pages, and (4) publish the package to the npmjs and GPR registries (not yet
# implemented).
#
# The workflow to upload static content to GitHub Pages (publish.yml) will
# kick off following successful completion of this workflow.
