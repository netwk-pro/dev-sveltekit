# When a release is created or this workflow is manually triggered, it will:
# (1) confirm the CodeQL analysis was successful, (2) test JavaScript using
# Mocha and Chai frameworks, (3) check linting with ESLint and formatting with
# Prettier without making changes, (4) build the project using node lts/* on
# ubuntu-24.04, and (5) publish the package to the npmjs and GPR registries.
#
# The workflow to upload static content to GitHub Pages (upload.yml) will
# kick off following successful completion of this workflow.
